# About this project

Arbor is a visual prompt designer and organizer for LLM agents.
It helps you structure, refine, and reuse prompts — including regular prompts, Cursor commands, and Claude skills — in a clear, composable way.

## Key features

**LLM-assisted drafting** Generate and refine prompt drafts with AI before turning them into structured components.

**Visual prompt composition** Design and polish prompts through a mind-map style editor, making complex prompt logic easier to reason about.

**Reusable prompt LEGO** Break prompts into reusable building blocks and maintain your own library of composable prompt pieces.

**Local deployment via CLI** Export to .md or .json, or sync directly into your local AI workflows (e.g. ~/.claude/skills) using a lightweight CLI bridge.
